#Description

A1-A8 are school homework I did in the first class I took in my masters, it was also my first time coding in Java. Funny enough, for A1 I created my own sorting algorithm, it's bad but I did it without stack overflow horray.
The best sample from it is A7, the calculator. While in every delivery I went above and beyound what was asked, that one I made especially cool with a homerbrewed resizing feature.
Other than that, the Multithreaded Workload Manager is a project I did for fun because I wanted to see how quickly I could create my own thread pool and do some math. It's not pretty, but it worked.

After this class I never really used pure Java again.
