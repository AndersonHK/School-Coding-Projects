Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without\\\\nthe prior written consent of Thomson Reuters. \\'Thomson Reuters\\' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork.

Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without\\\\nthe prior written consent of Thomson Reuters. \\'Thomson Reuters\\' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\", \"SUMMARY\\\\nI. 4Q16 BUSINESS REVIEW (T.C.)\\\\nA. Highlights:\\\\n1. Results for Sept. qtr. were strong.\\\\n2. Revenue $46.9b.\\\\na.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without\\\\nthe prior written consent of Thomson Reuters. \\'Thomson Reuters\\' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We\\'re in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe\\'re holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it\\'s something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we\\'re seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we\\'ve said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we\\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we\\'ve ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we\\'re working very hard to get them into customers\\' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe\\'re also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world\\'s most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members\\' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe\\'ve just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We\\'ve made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We\\'re seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers\\' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We\\'ve been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we\\'ve also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We\\'ve extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe\\'re already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we\\'re very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it\\'s driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we\\'re seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey\\'re offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we\\'re partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we\\'re just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe\\'re also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe\\'re also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I\\'d like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Thomson Reuters content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without\\\\nthe prior written consent of Thomson Reuters. \\'Thomson Reuters\\' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we\\'re working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That\\'s up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I\\'d like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we\\'ll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel\\'s iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I\\'d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I\\'d like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products.

Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter.

We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor.

Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products.

We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n/tSUMMARY\\\\nI. 4Q16 BUSINESS REVIEW (T.C.)\\\\nA. Highlights:\\\\n1. Results for Sept. qtr. were strong.\\\\n2. Revenue $46.9b.\\\\na.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home.

Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home.

We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\",\n",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

'Thomson Reuters' and the Thomson Reuters logo are registered trademarks of Thomson Reuters and its affiliated\\\\ncompanies.\\\\n594OCTOBER 25, 2016 / 9:00PM, AAPL - Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call\\\\nGross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\\\n3\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\\\n4\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares.

We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\\\nfew months.\\\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\\\nas possible.\\\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\\\nmemories.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\\\nin our monthly active users.\\\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\\\nacross the enterprise.\\\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\\\nand support.\\\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\\\nSeptember quarter.\\\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\\\ninventory.\\\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\\\ncustomers and developers.\\\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\\\ntarget range.\\\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\\\n5\\\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\\\nbillion.\\\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\\\n\""

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week,\\nwe're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.\\nOur results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance\\nrange. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range.\\nWe sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters as we forecasted\\nin January. IPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal\\ncustomers in the world and FY16 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before.\\nThis is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other Company can match. We had a record-setting\\nquarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion.\\nApp store revenue continued to skyrocket while music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple music. In fact, JD Power\\nrecently announced that Apple music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.\\nEarlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments\\nwhere they commute, dine, and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong\\ngrowth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next\\nfew months.\\nApple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year on year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of\\nSeptember than we did across all of FY15.\\nAnd, with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners\\ntell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.\\nWe remain very confident about the future of our services business, given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty of our\\ngrowing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be\\nthe size of a Fortune 100 Company in FY17. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.\\nThese are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance\\nand battery life ever, thanks to the custom design Apple A10 Fusion [chip]. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and\\ncome in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly\\nas possible.\\nWe're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smart watch, packed with new features\\nincluding built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display, and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are\\nrecognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated, and connected.\\nOne recent example is Aetna which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch\\nfor individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to\\nencourage them to live a healthier day.\\nWe've just rolled out new versions of iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS, and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac,\\nenhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch, and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call\\nmemories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink,\\n3\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App store for messages, and there has been a marked increase\\nin our monthly active users.\\nOne of the great new features of iOS 10 is the home app which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can\\neasily set up and securely control all their home kit accessories from lights and cameras to garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite\\niOS devices. We expect over 100 home kit compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple,\\nto help ensure customers' security when using them.\\nOur Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems,\\nmachine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive, and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for\\nyears to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.\\nToday, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10 which offer\\nsuggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses\\nadvanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find.\\nMachine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning\\ncontinually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening\\nit to developers, and most recently, by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.\\nWe're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with\\nthe engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a first-of-its-kind,\\nall-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country.\\nThey're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their\\nnetwork. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in FY16 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface\\nof this large and growing market opportunity.\\nWe're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership\\nwith Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS\\nplatform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions\\nacross the enterprise.\\nWe're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20\\nindustries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on\\nanother incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our\\namazing developer community for their relentless creativity, and our wonderful customers, business partners, and shareholders for their loyalty\\nand support.\\nNow, I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\\nLuca Maestri - Apple Inc. - CFO\\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.\\nRevenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strong in many emerging\\nmarkets including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand, and Vietnam. We continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.\\n4\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters. All rights reserved.

Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net\\nincome was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion which is a new record for the\\nSeptember quarter.\\nFor details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and\\niPhone 7 plus, and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we\\nincreased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five- to seven-week target range of channel\\ninventory.\\nWe experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern\\nEurope, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. IPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to\\niPhone 7 and 7 plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than\\nour September-quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.\\nWorldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 plus. And, we're working very hard to get\\nthe new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.\\nIPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we\\nlaunched iPhone SE, and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a\\nlevel similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.\\nCustomer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the US, for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found\\nthat among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting\\na 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measures a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating\\nand found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.\\nTurning to services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App store growth rate has\\nnow accelerated for five consecutive quarters reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App store remains the preferred destination for both\\ncustomers and developers.\\nAccording to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance\\nfrom Apps, we saw strong, double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically\\nas Tim mentioned. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.\\nWe sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac\\ninstalled base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future\\nMac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four- to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.\\nTurning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad\\nPro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five- to seven-week\\ntarget range.\\nWe continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete.\\nRecent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the US tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above\\n$200. And, in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro.\\nAmong US consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase\\nintention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a\\n94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.\\n5\\nTHOMSON REUTERS STREETEVENTS | www.streetevents.com | Contact Us\\nÂ©2017 Thomson Reuters.

Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger\\nwith over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution\\npartner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad-based, POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations\\nworldwide including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.\\nIBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more\\nthan 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are three times the cost to manage,\\ndrive twice the number of support calls, and are five times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs.\\nThanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the Company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing\\nthe total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a [four]-year life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion\\nin cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion.\\n$216 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term\\ndebt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows.\\nWe paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open-market transactions,\\nand we launched a new $3 billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated\\nshare repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So, total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.\\nWe have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the\\nSeptember quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8\\nbillion.\\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a different geographic mix of earnings\\nrelative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy\\nreferred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the\\nall-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.\\nWe expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about\\n$400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.\\nAlso, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders\\nof record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\\nNancy Paxton - Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR\\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\\n\n"
